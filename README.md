# To get started...
Install all dependencies for frontend with `yarn install` each time you're pulling a new commit<br/>
Open a new terminal and enter `yarn start` to start the development server <br/>
Ensure all dependencies are installed for Flask env (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) **virtual env must be active before running this command**<br/>
If you're in the root directory you can start the api with `yarn api_win` or `yarn api_mac` depending on your OS<br/>
### All good!
## TODO:
implement database to reflect all changes<br/>
